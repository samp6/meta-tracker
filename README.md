# meta-tracker
Built for Magic: the Gathering, but applicable anywhere there's a "metagame". 

The tool lets you track the deck archetypes you've played against. You can view these stats at an all-time level, or view them within smaller timeframes. 

Purposefully did not include Winrate tracking - this is just to see "what's on the ladder". 

This was not meant to be a serious tool, more practice for my own sake. That being said, it is replacing something I was doing manually, so it's helped a bit. More features and cleanup to come.
